# DocuTrench! 

## What is?
**DocuTrench** is a very simple document management system that uses an e-mail pipeline to help you keep track of your documents, invoices, etc. 
Using Google APIs, it extracts document straight from an e-mail inbox and adds them to a dashboard. All your vendors have to do is e-mail *your_company*.*their_company*@docutrench.com with any attachments and the documents will be available in your dashboard in a matter of seconds. From there you can mark them as "Inspected", "Paid", "Need signature", etc. All documents are organised by the vendor who sent them and all stored documents are encrypted for added security.

DocuTrench does not provide any methods of paying invoices or interacting further - all it is is a documents management system.
